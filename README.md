<h4 align="center">The forgotten story of the images.</h4>


**Story behind the Image** <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:4em;">Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii (1863-1944) was a photographer who, between the years 1909-1915, traveled the Russian empire and took thousands of photos of everything he saw. He used an early color technology that involved recording three exposures of every scene onto a glass plate using a red, green, and blue filter. Back then, there was no way to print such photos, and they had to be displayed using a special projector.</span>

<span style="font-family:Open Sans; font-size:4em;">Here, the goal was to work with images in Matlab by taking the digitized Prokudin-Gorskii glass plate images and automatically producing a color image.</span>
